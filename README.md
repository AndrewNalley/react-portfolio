## Description

- This landing page will be a useful tool for me, both now and in the future, in that I can direct future employers here to view my work. The goal was to use HTML and CSS to make this page striking, legible, clear, and easy to navigate. It is striking because it uses a global color palette and makes use of soft corners. It is legible because the font is large and legible. It is clear because the styling does not get in the way of the content. It is easy to navigate because of the nav bar and the large headings. 

This page will become an important platform for my future work, and it will be a testing area for new styles and ideas. 

Instead of being another applicant in the ocean of LinkedIn, this site will help me stand out, and I can direct future employers here directly. 

A simple website is often not so simple, especially if one wishes to maintain a consistent visual language. I have learned that it takes a lot of time to make a legible, usable, and attractive website.
